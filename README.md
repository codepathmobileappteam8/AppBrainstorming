## iRepair

### App Description
iRepair is an app that allows users to view and submit manuals related to automotive repairs. Almost everyone owns a car, but don't enjoy the costs of repair and constant maintenance. iRepair will empower the individual who wishes to attempt these tasks themselves by connecting them with a community who wants to help.

### App Idea Evaluation


- Mobile: Users can utilize Camera, and Audio to view and submit repair videos for their vehicles. Location and Map features can be used to locate Auto stores in their area.
- Story: Empowers the individual to attempt their own repais, and fosters a community of DIY auto repair enthusiasts.
- Market: The market for this app is large and growing more as more people are trying to fix things on their own nowadays.
- Habit: User's will get in the habit of doing their own repairs and referencing the app for help, while others work on developing content to share.
- Scope: The concept for the app is as familiar as sites such as Youtube and online forums. Thus an MVP of it would still be a valuable resource for the user.
